    "Ans) Multiprocessing in Python is a module that enables the creation of multiple processes to run parallelly on different CPU cores, thus making use of the full potential of the system. It is useful for CPU-bound tasks, such as scientific computing, data analysis, and simulations, that require heavy processing and can be divided into smaller subtasks that can run concurrently. Multiprocessing can significantly improve the performance and speed of such tasks.\n"

    "Ans) The main difference between multiprocessing and multithreading is that multiprocessing involves the use of multiple processes, each with its own memory space and resources, whereas multithreading involves multiple threads within a single process, all sharing the same memory space and resources. This means that multiprocessing can take full advantage of multi-core CPUs, whereas multithreading is suitable for I/O-bound tasks, such as web scraping, where multiple threads can work simultaneously without blocking each other."

    "Ans) A multiprocessing pool in Python is a way to create a group of worker processes that can work on a task in parallel. It is useful for distributing tasks among a fixed number of worker processes and managing the communication between them. The pool manages a queue of tasks and distributes them to the worker processes as they become available, thus optimizing the use of system resources and improving the efficiency of the task execution."
