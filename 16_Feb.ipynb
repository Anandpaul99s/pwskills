    "A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to efficiently manage, store, and retrieve large amounts of data. Databases are widely used in various fields such as business, finance, healthcare, education, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types of database management systems with different architectures and data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use tables to store data. Each table contains columns that define the attributes of the data, and each row represents a single record. SQL databases use a schema to define the structure of the database and enforce data integrity. SQL databases are widely used in enterprise applications and have a well-defined standard for querying and managing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use tables to store data. They use different data models, such as document-based, key-value, or graph-based. NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable and provide high performance for large-scale data storage and retrieval. They do not have a schema, allowing for greater flexibility in storing and querying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases use a relational data model with tables, rows, and columns, while NoSQL databases use various non-relational data models such as document-based, key-value, graph-based, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema: SQL databases have a well-defined schema to enforce data integrity, while NoSQL databases are schema-less, allowing for more flexibility in storing and querying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, while SQL databases are vertically scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language, while NoSQL databases use various query languages specific to their data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance: NoSQL databases are optimized for performance and can handle large-scale data storage and retrieval, while SQL databases are better suited for complex queries and transactional processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the data being stored."

    "\n",
    "2. DROP: Used to delete an entire database, table, view, or index. For example\n",
    "\tDROP TABLE Customers;\n",
    "3. ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing table or view. For example, adding a new column to a table:\n",
    "\tALTER TABLE Customers ADD COLUMN Age int;\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: Used to delete all data from a table without deleting the table itself. For example\n",
